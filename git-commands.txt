//Clone & Status

clone - cloning a repository on our local machine

 	> git clone <-some link-> //link mostly https

status - display the status of the code
   	> git status



// Types of git status

Untracked
   	- new file that git doesn't yet track
2. Modified
 	- changed
3. Staged
 	- file is ready to be committed
4. Unmodified
 	- unchanged




// Add & Commit

add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
 	git add <-file name->

commit- it is the record of change
 	git commit - "some message"

//Push Command
push - upload local repo content to remote repo
 	> git push origin main


//Init Command
 	init - used to create a new git repo
 		git init
 		git remote add origin <-link->
 		git remote -v (to verify remote)
 		git branch  (to check branch)
 		git branch -M main ( to rename branch)
 		git push origin main / git push -u origin main (-u allows you to just write git push) 




//Git Branches
	- git branch (to check branch)
	- git branch -M main (to rename branch)
	- git checkout <-branch name-> (to navigate)
	- git checkout -b <-new branch name-> (to create new branch)
	- git branch -d <-branch name-> (to delete branch)



//Merging Code
	Way 1
	- git diff <-branch name-> (to compare commits, branches, files & more)]
	- git merge <-branch name-> ( to merge 2 branches)

	
	Way 2
	- Create a PR (PULL REQUEST)

	//PULL REQUEST
	- It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub


//Pull Command
	- used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match the content
	
	> git pull origin main


//Resolving Merge Conflicts
	- An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

	> git merge <-branch name->



//Undoing Changes

	Case 1: staged changes ( changes that are already added but not committed)
		> git reset <-file name->
		> git reset


	Case 2: committed changes (for one commit)
		> git reset HEAD-1


	Case 3: committed changes (for many commits)
		> git reset <-commit hash->
		> git reset --hard <-commit hash->
	

//Fork
- A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.

- Fork is a rough copy.
